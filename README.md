# Airline Analysis Project


<sup>GitHub won't show plotly plots (interactive charts), please view them here [nbviewer_airlineanalysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/darrenlxu/airline-analysis/blob/main/main.ipynb) instead.</sup>

<b>Description</b>
------
This is a project based on a made-up scenario: 

<i>"A start-up airline wants you to provide a report that addresses the following criteria prior to its official launch. Conduct data analysis and provide 
visualizations that may assist you with this task."</i>

Criteria:

- Airline is based in the United States, so recommend a US hub/base üá∫üá∏
- Propose a fleet, short and long range capabilites ‚úàÔ∏è
- Provide some predictions üìà
- Potential routes both domestic and international üåé
- Include visualizations and a report on cost of purchasing selected aircraft üìä
- And, anything else that may be helpful ‚úÖ

<b>Introduction</b>
------
The data sets used have been collated by me off the web. They have been provided. The majority of the code was written in Python through Jupyter Notebooks.
All files related to this project have also been provided in this repository. 

First, we will examine and clean/tidy our data sets. Next with the now relevant/short-listed data, we began to collate our analysis, finalizing our results and final decisions whilst simultaneously addressing the airline's criteria.

For full code, visualizations and analysis, refer to the Jupyter Notebooks (<i>.ipynb</i>) or [nbviewer_airlineanalysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/darrenlxu/airline-analysis/blob/main/main.ipynb).

<b>Cleaning & Short Listing Data</b>
------
Multiple data sets were loaded into MySQL and the process of cleaning and short listing data was done using Python's MySQL Connector library. We addressed multiple criteria to cut down to the final best remaining planes. From this, we produced finalists in aircraft choice and airport choice [<i>see sqlqueries.ipynb</i>]. Most airlines operate both short-range and long-range aircraft so we have decided to do the same. Only two aerospace manufacturers are in contention for both types of aircraft, Airbus (A...) and Boeing (7...).

For short-range and long-range aircraft, the choices will be between:<br>

class node:
    def __init__(self, data = None):
        self.data = data 
        self.next = None 

class sra:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None 

    def showdeliveryrate(self):
        if self.head == None:
            return None

        rates = [str(round(((1172/3857) * 100), 2)) + '%', str(round(((481/3437) * 100), 2)) + '%', str(round(((435/(2135 + 234)) * 100), 2)) + '%']

        traverse = self.head 
        while traverse != None:
            for i in range(3):
                print(traverse.data + rates[i])
                traverse = traverse.next

smallplanes = sra()

smallplanes.head = node('A320neo -> ')
smallplanes1 = node('A321neo -> ')
smallplanes2 = node('737 MAX -> ')

<br>__Final Decision__</br>

Based on the data we have collected and using the visualizations generated:

- We will recommend the <b>A320neo</b> and the <b>737 MAX 8</b>

The expectation is that for short-range aircraft, they will only be used for domestic flights within the United States. Flight range from LAX to the East coast is at most 2,500 nautical miles so we simply won't need the bigger, more expensive A321neo. Seating is very similar across the A320neo, 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 9 airplanes so that wouldn't have much impact. The A320neo is a very popular aircraft based on orders and delivery rate so that was also taken into account. Further, we noticed that Boeing airplanes can reach higher cruising altitudes (increases fuel efficiency) so we decided this would be beneficial. Also, we took into account that Boeing factories are located within the US and purchasing from a US company may have political, economical and goodwill benefits. Selecting the cheapest airplane from both Boeing and Airbus also addresses diversity within the fleet and the airline's needs. Hence, the decision to go with the MAX and the neo.

<br>__Final Decision__</br>

Based on the data we have collected and using the visualizations generated:

- We will recommend the <b>A350-1000</b> and the <b>747-8i</b>

The expectation is that long-range aircraft only service international flights. From the price chart, we notice that Boeing is much more expensive on average than Airbus. We decide that the ranges and takeoff performance for all four airplanes are sufficient for potential international routes. Also, LAX's runway length is also sufficient to operate all four airplanes. Seating wise, the 747-8i's capacity is a very attractive and we will recommend to send the 747-8i for the most popular international destinations. Performance in the air with the 747-8i is excellent with its 43,000ft maximum cruising altitude (great of fuel efficiency). Further, we would like to continue the relationship with Boeing as mentioned before. We simply did not select the 777-9X based off no deliveries as the airplane is still in production. The reason we decided to go with the A350-1000 over the -900 is range and capability to hold more weight (or cargo). We would like the airline to keep the possibility of ultra-long haul routes and we believe this will mitigate the need to purchase entirely new aircraft because of the -1000's already extremely long range capability. Choosing from both Airbus and Boeing will allow pilots to easily transition from the A320neo to the A350-1000 and the 737 MAX 8 to the 747-8i when the time comes, reducing training costs. Hence, the decision to go with the 747 and the -1000.

Throughout this project we have found the airline's short-range aircraft as well as long-range aircraft. We have also established a home base/hub for the airline. We also recommended potential routes for the airline to operate on a domestic and international level. We used data analysis, scraping and visualization techniques to reach this, along with addressing the airline's criteria and requirements.
