[nbviewer_airlineanalysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/darrenlxu/airline-analysis/blob/main/main.ipynb) is better than main.ipynb because of GitHub not displaying plotly charts. 

Within [nbviewer_airlineanalysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/darrenlxu/airline-analysis/blob/main/main.ipynb), there are separate file links or go 
to the viewplotly folder to view geographic plots which are not shown in the viewer. 

<u>Steps for those geographic plots:</u>
1. Open link in new tab
2. Download html file
3. Once downloaded, open the html file in Chrome/drag file from downloads into new tab/browser
4. Interact with plotly graph
